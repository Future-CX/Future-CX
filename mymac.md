## MacOS settings


### Desktop & Dock settings
- I am reducing the size of the dock and autohiding it
- I keep the position of the Dock to the bottom
- I like the minimize windows into the application icon to keep the Dock clean
- I uncheck the option to show suggested and recent apps in Dock
- I like to keep a clean desktop so uncheck the option 'Show Items'
- I dont use Stagemanager currently
- I set the Widget style to Monochrome
- **The new feature in Sequoia for resize and arrange windows is awesome!**
