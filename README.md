## Designing and Delivering technical solutions that customers need

Hi, my name is Martijn,

I started my career as a web developer and grew into an experienced Solution Architect.

My passion is to deliver innovative and technical solutions that customers need. Customer Experience is at my heart, as it requires constant change, new technology, and ways of working. Whilst keeping the customer at the center.

With my experience in CX technology and customer-first thinking, I can bring the value customers expect from you.
